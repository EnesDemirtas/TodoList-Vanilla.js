# TodoList with Vanilla.js
This is a simple Todo-List project coded using pure Javascript for practicing.

I followed a Udemy course video and copied those codes to learn.

**This practice project belongs to Udemy Instructor "*Mustafa Murat Coskun*".**


## What does TodoList do?

  - Takes todos and adds them to TodoList

  - Stores the todos on local storage and bring them back to interface when page is reloaded or opened again

  - Allows you to delete todos

  - Allows you to search a todo among all todos

  - Allows you to delete all todos with a button from both interface and local storage

## What've I learned from this project?

* DOM Manipulation

  - Selecting elements by their ids/classnames
  - Reaching the parents/children of elements
  - Changing elements' textContent, innerHTML etc.

* Storage Usage
* Event Listeners
* All of the other stuffs used in project
